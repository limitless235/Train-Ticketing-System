# Train-Ticketing-System
This project focuses on a Train Ticket Reservation System. It allows users to view train schedules, search for trains, check seat availability, and find train timings. Users can also check ticket fares for different trains and get details about trains running between two stations. Additionally, seats can be booked online, offering a secure and reliable reservation process.
